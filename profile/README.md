The SnapperGPS receiver is a small, low-cost, and low-power GNSS receiver for non-real-time wildlife tracking.
It employs the snapshot GNSS technology, which offloads the computationally expensive data processing to the cloud, and:
* Can operate for more than a year,
* Needs only 12 ms of signal reception for a fix,
* Employs multiple satellite systems for improved reliability (GPS, Galileo, and BeiDou),
* Achieves a median real-world tracking accuracy of about 12 m (before smoothing),
* Measures the temperature in addition,
* Is configured via USB in your browser without the need to install a driver or an app, and
* Is [certified](https://certification.oshwa.org/uk000049.html) open-source hardware.
